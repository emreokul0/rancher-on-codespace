--------------------------------------------------------

The error you're encountering indicates a conflict between Docker's `docker-init` and the `moby-tini` package. Specifically, both packages attempt to install a file at `/usr/libexec/docker/docker-init`, which is causing a conflict during the installation of `docker-ce`.

### Steps to Resolve the Conflict

#### Step 1: **Remove the Conflicting Package (`moby-tini`)**
The package `moby-tini` is no longer required, as indicated in the error message. You can remove it to resolve the conflict.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove moby-tini
```

This should remove `moby-tini`, which is conflicting with the installation of Docker.

#### Step 2: **Clean Up Any Leftover Packages**
Run the following command to clean up any partially installed packages and ensure your package list is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Step 3: **Reinstall Docker**
Now, try reinstalling Docker after removing the conflicting package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

#### Step 4: **Verify Docker Installation**
Once the installation completes successfully, verify that Docker is installed:

```bash
docker --version
```

This should return the installed Docker version.

#### Optional: **Force Overwrite (Not Recommended)**

If for some reason you cannot remove `moby-tini` (or it's critical for your setup), you could force `dpkg` to overwrite the conflicting file. However, this is not recommended because it can lead to unstable behavior:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/docker-ce_5%3a27.3.1-1~ubuntu.20.04~focal_amd64.deb
```

This forces the installation to overwrite the existing `docker-init` file, but it may cause issues if `moby-tini` is used in your environment.

### Conclusion
The best course of action is to remove `moby-tini` to resolve the conflict and allow Docker to install cleanly. After the steps above, Docker should install successfully. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
