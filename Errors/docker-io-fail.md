-------------------------------------------------------------

To update or install `containerd.io` to version `>= 1.6.24`, you can follow these steps to ensure that the correct version of `containerd.io` is installed. This is crucial when trying to install Docker, as Docker has specific version requirements for `containerd.io`.

### Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **Remove Existing containerd.io (if any)**
If you already have an older or conflicting version of `containerd.io`, it’s best to remove it first.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove containerd.io
```

### 2. **Add Docker’s Official Repository**
Docker maintains a repository where you can get the latest versions of `containerd.io`, `docker-ce`, and other related tools.

- Install required packages to allow apt to use repositories over HTTPS:
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
  ```

- Add Docker’s GPG key:
  
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  ```

- Add Docker’s repository to your sources list:

  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
  ```

### 3. **Update Package Index**
After adding the Docker repository, update your package list again:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### 4. **Install containerd.io >= 1.6.24**
Now, install `containerd.io` from the Docker repository, which should include the required version or newer:

```bash
sudo apt-get install containerd.io
```

To install a specific version (e.g., `1.6.24`), use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install containerd.io=1.6.24-1
```

This ensures that version `1.6.24` of `containerd.io` is installed. If a newer version is available, it will be listed when you run the `apt-get install` command, so you can install it if you wish.

### 5. **Verify the Installed Version**
To verify that the correct version of `containerd.io` is installed:

```bash
containerd --version
```

This should return version `1.6.24` or newer.

### 6. **Continue Installing Docker**
Now that `containerd.io` is correctly installed, you can proceed with installing Docker (if you haven't already) using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

By following these steps, you should be able to update `containerd.io` to version `1.6.24` or higher and resolve any issues related to installing Docker. Let me know if you run into any other issues!
